    "### **8. A park in Chennai has introduced a new skateboard competition. The skating surface is a grid of N x N squares. Most squares are so constructed with slopes that it is possible to direct the skateboard in any of up to three directions of the possible four (North ,East, South or West, represented by the letters N, E, S and W respectively). Some squares however have a deep drop from the adjacent square from which it is impossible to go to any adjacent square. These are represented by D (for Drop) in that square. The objective is to maneuver the skateboard to reach the South East corner of the grid, marked F.**\n",

The next N lines have a N strings of characters representing the contents of the map for that corresponding row. Each string may be F, representing the Final destination, D, representing a drop square, or a set of up to three of the possible four directions (N,E,S,W) in some random order.
